    "Steganography, according to CompTIA (https://www.comptia.org/blog/what-is-steganography), is the practice of hiding a secret message in a non-secret medium. What's the edge it gives us over cryptography? Consider a message like QFD FCGSG SFSEG - it's patently obvious that it's encoded! But what if we encountered a picture on a public website? Would we think to look for a message - even one written entirely in plaintext - there?"

    "Here, we will implement a steganography technique known as Least Significant Bit encryption. Of course, we'll write a decryptor too! A more detailed overview can be found at https://towardsdatascience.com/hiding-data-in-an-image-image-steganography-using-python-e491b68b1372, but for those of us who want a quick summary, our strategy will be as follows:\n",
    "- Convert an image's pixels to their RGB brightness values.\n",
    "- Convert our message into binary - beginning and ending with a delimiter so we can decrypt it no matter where it is in the image.\n",
    "- Replace the least significant bit of each pixel's colour's brightness values with that of our message.\n",
    "- Test the image on our decryptor with a given delimiter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cool part of this technique is that you don't need to _read_ an image into binary to implement it - by replacing the least significant bit, you just add 1, subtract 1, or keep the number the same. The tricky part is iterating over all of these LSBs to find the message!\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a pixel with R = 99, which is 1100011 in binary. If our message had a 1 or 0 at this position, we'd either end up with 1100011 (returning us 99), or 1100010 (giving us 98) respectively."
